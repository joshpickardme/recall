## Description
Recall was my end of apprenticeship bootcamp project for [Multiverse](https://www.multiverse.io) where I was tasked with creating a full stack web application. This is the result. I took a lot of inspiration from the active recall application, Anki, and put my own unique twist on it. I'm proud of the result, but I have no intention of fixing it or adding to it. (at least not in this repository). 

Some things I learnt:
- Used MongoDB. Never used it before and I really enjoyed my experience with it. I can definitely see myself using it for my personal projects.
- By some miracle, users were able to sign in with Google instead of creating an account and trusting me with their data. I found this really tricky but rewarding once it worked.
- Loved using Framer Motion to make (pointless and stupid) animations.
